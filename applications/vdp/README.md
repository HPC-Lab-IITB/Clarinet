The "Hello World" of applications - Vector Dot Product of two arrays.

The following variations are supported:

1. Float-VDP
2. Posit-VDP using float input data
3. Posit-VDP using posit input data

In the case of posit input data 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit posits are supported

In order to vary the length of the VDP computation, the REP macro is used. 

To compile and simulate all variants on Clarinet run the python script:

`../batch-compile --help`
