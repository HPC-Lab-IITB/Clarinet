The "Hello World" of applications - Vector Dot Product of two arrays.

The following variations are supported:

   Float-VDP
   Posit-VDP using float input data
   Posit-VDP using posit input data

In the case of posit input data 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit posits are supported

In order to vary the length of the VDP computation, the REP macro is used. 

To compile all variants run the python script ./batch-compile
