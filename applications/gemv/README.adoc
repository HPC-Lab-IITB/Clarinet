# GEMV - Matrix-Vector Product
Uses vector dot product (VDP) under the hood.

The following variations are supported:

. Float-VDP
. Posit-VDP using float input data
. Posit-VDP using posit input data

In the case of posit input data 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit posits are supported

`VSZ` varies the dimension of the matrix and vector. The matrix is a square matrix of size
`VSZ`x`VSZ`, the vector is 1x`VSZ`

To generate the data, compile and simulate all variants on Clarinet run the python script:

`../batch-compile --compile --sim --main gemv --level 2`
